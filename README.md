# Array-Data-Strructures-Algorithms
An array is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Each element is accessed using an index, allowing fast and direct access. Arrays have a fixed size, making insertion and deletion operations inefficient due to element shifting.
